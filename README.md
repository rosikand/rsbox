# `rsbox`: Utility Toolbox

([Github](https://github.com/rosikand/rsbox) | [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rsbox))

A toolbox of utility functions [I](http://rosikand.github.io/) commonly use when programming in Python.

The full API consists of importable functions from modules located in `src/rsbox/`. Functions are documented via comment blocks under the function header. 

## Installation 

```
$ pip install rsbox
```

## Modules 

The modules are located in `src/rsbox/`

- `ml_utils.py`: machine learning programming utilities. 


## Version changelog

### `0.0.2`
